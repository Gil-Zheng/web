    <h1> About Badminton</h1>
  <p> 
        Badminton is a indoor sport played with a racket and a shuttlecock. The sport dates back to Ancient Greece, China, and India. 
    It is played on a court with the dimensions of 44 feet by 17 feet and a 5 feet net. The goal is to hit the shuttlecock onto the desinated area on the other 
    side of the net. If the opponent returns the shuttlecock over net; it is called a rally and continues until one messes up.
