		<p> First the two .csv files are read and opened. The listed function takes all the temperaments from the CVS files and turns it into a list. The questionaire function is the main program the game runs on. It goes through the data and list and sorts it and it eliminates each temperaments from the list base on the answer. After all the questions are answer, it'll pick the best choice/guess. The questioner function transports everything to the shell, it will ask the input questions base on if its a cat or a dog. </p>
