  There are a few rules in badminton. For example, the players arent allowed to touch the net with both their bodies and racket. The shuttlecock shouldn't go outside of the boundary lines. The birdie shouldn't hit the ceiling or rest on a racket. Players can't move until the shuttlecock is served. To serve the birdie, you stand on the service line and the racket should be under the waist.
And serve with an underhand motion.
