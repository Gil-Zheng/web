<h1> About Badminton </h1> 
<div class="text"> 
<p> 
  Badminton is a indoor sport played with a racket and a shuttlecock. The sport dates back to Ancient Greece, China, and India. The shuttlecock is a ball covered in feathers so there is more drag. It is played on a court with the dimensions of 44 feet by 17 feet and a 5 feet net. The goal is to hit the shuttlecock onto the desinated area on the other side of the net. The sport has been in the Summer Olympics since 1992.
